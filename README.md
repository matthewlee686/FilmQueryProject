# Film Query Project

## About the Project
* This Project showcases a Film Search Program
* The Program allows a User to:
  * Search for a Film using a Film ID
  * Search for a Film using a query search that will then apply to the title or description in the Films in the database
* The Program is connected to an Oracle Database and uses SQL (mysql) to perform queries based on the User's choice to perform the search
* When displayed, the User will be able to see a Film's:
  * title
  * year released
  * rating (G, PG, etc.)
  * description
  * language
  * Actors starred
* If no Film ID exits the Program notifies the User
* Search queries will return a Numeric Result in addition to the information
  * Search queries with no result will simply display '0 Results Found'
